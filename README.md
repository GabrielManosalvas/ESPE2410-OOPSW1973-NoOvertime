Problem

The administrator of a homeowner's association needs a system to efficiently manage all the administration tasks of the association. This program must include functionalities to cover all administration needs, from the control of the residents' fee payments to the maintenance of the facilities and the communication between the administrator and the owners or tenants.

Summary

In the management of homeowners' communities, an administrator is responsible for multiple tasks essential to the smooth running of the premises, such as managing monthly payments from residents, scheduling maintenance, resolving incidents and organizing events or meetings. A comprehensive management system would allow the manager to keep a clear and updated record of all these activities, improve communication with residents and optimize the use of condominium resources. This type of tool facilitates the manager's organization and contributes to maintaining resident satisfaction .

Context

A condominium, in general terms, is a group of individual housing units that share common areas, such as gardens, parking lots and recreational areas. Each resident usually contributes a monthly fee to the maintenance and improvement of these common areas. Often, a manager is hired to manage these funds and ensure that the condominium is in good condition.
